## Concepts Covered
- SUM()
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- MIN(), MAX()
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ROUND()
- Counting distinct values

## SQL Queries Implemented

### 1. Aggregate Functions
- Calculate total, average, minimum, and maximum salaries.
- Count total employees.

### 2. GROUP BY Usage
- Summarize total salary per department.
- Find average salary by job title.

### 3. HAVING Clause
- Filter groups where total salary exceeds a given threshold.

### 4. COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column)
- Demonstrated the difference between counting all rows vs non-NULL values.

### 5. ROUND()
- Rounded average salaries to 2 decimal places.

### 6. Multiple Column Grouping
- Grouped data by department and job title.

### 7. Counting Distinct Values
- Counted unique job titles.

## Output
The queries provide summaries like:
- Total/average salary by department.
- Departments with salary budgets above thresholds.
- Employee counts by job and department.
- Distinct job role counts.
